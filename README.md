# Total-Path-Algorithm
This will analyze the total paths from the top right corner to the bottom left corner of an N x N grid using recursion,memoization,and dynamic programming methods. These algorithms will assume that the only legal moves are down or to the right.

Information: 
  All programs will be in python, and all algorithms will be tested using the same driver code shown as driver.py.
  
  Features:
    Basic recursion method
    
  TO-DO:
    Basic recursion method
    Memoization
    Dynamic Programming algorithm
    Runtime analysis of all three of the above algorithms
